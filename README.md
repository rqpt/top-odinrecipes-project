# odin-recipes

With my first proper project, I will be building a basic recipe site. 

I will probably be making a few unordered lists, inserting a few images into my pages, and practicing both relative and absolute links.

I should be able to style my page abit with basic bold and italic element tags.

Once I'm done with my project I will update this readme file with my reflection.

Let's see how this goes!
