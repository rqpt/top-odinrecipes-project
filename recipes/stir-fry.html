            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>With this dish, you can just chuck whatever you have on hand
                into the pan. As long as there is a protein and a veggie, I'm happy
                and you've succeeded in making a stir fry.</p>
                
            <p>If you're <em>really</em> adventurous you can add some fruitiness
                to the mix. I'm going to show you how I make mine.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><Strong>Beef strips</Strong>- hmmm.. I think we're gonna
                leave this recipe at that.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Nothing else needed..this is good enough for me.</p>
            
            <p>Alright <em>fine</em>...</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beef strips</strong>- what do I look like, a guy whos not
                lazy?</li>
                <li><strong>Frozen Mcain's Stir Fry Veggies</strong>- ..yup, thats it.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Marmite</em></strong>- Yes, you heard that right. Two tablespoons.</li>
                <li><strong>Jam</strong>- I'm not sure which, but my wife chucks a lil bit into the pan
                when she comes around the kitchen. I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter which kind.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Pour some frozen veggies out of the pack into the pan.</li>
                <li>Blast the heat on <em>full</em> power.</li>
                <li>Stir the vegies every 10 seconds or so, so they get evenly
                    distributed around the pan.</li>
                <li>Add the beef strips after about 7 min of cooking</li>
                <li>Once the carrots are soft, you can add the jam and marmite and 
                    keep stirring.</li>
                <li>Once the beef is medium rarity its time to turn down the heat to
                    a simmer for 3 minutes with the lid on.</li>
                <li>Serve <strong><em>immediately</em></strong>.</li>
            </ol>
