            <h3 class="headings description">Description</h3>

            <p>This method is my preferred way to make and enjoy oats.
                As a warning, I don't beleive this to be a particularly healthy
                way to prepare oats. I'ts tasty though- lots of sugar, butter and syrup.</p>
                
            <p>I'ts really quick and I enjoy the flow of making it in the morning.</p>

            <h2 class="headings">Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oats</strong>- <em>rolled</em></li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong>- margarine also works</li>
                <li><strong>Caramel Syrup</strong>- or any other kind.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong>- or white..I just prefer brown.</li>
                <li><strong>Cinnamon</strong>- mix in with the sugar.</li>
                <li><strong>Milk</strong>- just a little bit</li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong>- so the oats don't end up bland</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="headings">Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Pour half a cup of dry oats into a deep microwavable bowl.</li>
                <li>Add a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Add a full cup of boiling water.</li>
                <li>Add a wooden spoon to the bowl and stir.</li>
                <li>Put the bowl into the microwave on high for 3 minutes, stirring every
                    1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add a tablespoon of butter <em>including</em> the spoon itself- this 
                will be your eating spoon.</li>
                <li>Generously season the oats with brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Add some dry oats to the top for extra texture.</li>
                <li>Add a few strings of syrup.</li>
                <li>Pour a <em>little</em> bit of milk into the bowl.</li>
                <li>Let your meal stand for a minute.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
